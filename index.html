    <p>Learning git hub</p> <br>
    <p>Bangladesh is a land of rivers and boats. Relevantly, a journey by boat is very common in our country. Last summer, I had the chance to make a journey by boat. My two bosom friends were with me. I enjoyed it a lot. One of our village friends invited us to his home. We three friends agreed to go. The distance was more than fifteen miles.</p>
